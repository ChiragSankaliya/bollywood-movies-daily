It is still remembered as the DDLJ of TV and remains to be a 'hot' fan favourite TV series. The story revolves around two core characters Angad and Kripa, who face many such challenges and obstacles in their way to unity and togetherness. A fraction of the story is based on the classic novel Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë. The story therefore focuses very strongly on the Byronic hero Angad, portrayed by Iqbal Khan, who presents the same flair, passion and vulnerability as Heathcliff. The show was an instant hit due to the sizzling chemistry between the two leading stars and has been re-aired on television through fan requests, multiple times.",

The mother, Desho, dreams of getting Bani married to an expatriate or Non Resident Indian man. For twenty two years there has been a division in Bani's family—between her father Sarabjit and his brother Nirvail. Despite this, Bani and Nirvail's daughter Rajji are the best of friends. Bani, though she respects Desho's wishes, is not too keen to marry an NRI. Rajji is aware of this.",
