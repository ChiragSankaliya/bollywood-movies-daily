This surf movie does a great job of staying far away from the politics of surfing and focuses more on soul surfing. However, don’t think that there aren’t any surfers worth watching in this movie because there are plenty. “Shelter” is jam packed with professional and well-known surfers such as Rob Machado, Taylor Knox, Joel Tudor, Mick Fanning, Dean Morrison, Jack Johnson, The Malloy’s, Kelly Slater, Nat Young, Donavon Frankenreiter, Shane Dorian, Jon Swift and many more.  The soundtrack for “Shelter” is similar to “Thicker Than Water” and “September Sessions”. It has a slower and mellower feel, featuring artists such as Mason Jennings, The Shins, White Buffalo and even surfers Jon Swift and Rob Machado.",

No matter what cultural history we explore, we discover a story very similar to the one we know about Atlantis...why? For years, experts and researchers have been looking in the wrong place, at the wrong people and for the wrong thing. For too long historians have focused on a few words left to us by Plato whose meaning they misunderstood. The fact is, even Plato didn't understand what had been told to him. The startling truth is that the remnants of Atlantis are all around us right now and have been for a very long time - long before recorded history. New research and insight exposes Atlantis to be a pivotal part of our ancient beginnings. The legendary lost city that many think of as myth, was in fact a very real and highly advanced civilization that was uniquely aware of the laws of the universe and was able to access hidden dimensions and make contact with extraterrestrial races.",

This radical new adaptation puts the audience’s engagement with the story centre-stage, amplifying the theatrical context of the original and creating truly innovative and thrilling cinematic vistas, whilst maintaining the language and themes of Shakespeare’s original play. Using background matte painting and computer modelling to generate the world in which the action plays out, the green screen allows Monkman to create his vision of a multi-tiered globe in which the characters play out their various fates.",

But leaders struggled with a secret: their own “same-sex attractions” never went away. After years as Christian superstars in the religious right, many of these men and women have come out as LGBTQ, disavowing the very movement they helped start. Focusing on the dramatic journeys of former conversion therapy leaders, current members, and a survivor, PRAY AWAY chronicles the “ex gay\" movement’s rise to power, persistent influence, and the profound harm it causes.",
