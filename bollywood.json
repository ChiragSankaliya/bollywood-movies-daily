Then Tony meets with attractive starlet named Sapna, and falls head over heels in love with her. When Sapna tells him that she is engaged to be married to Dr. Ajay Saxena, he is heart-broken. Then a scandal breaks out, and Hargobind is implicated in the deaths of three children that were killed by Raj's spurious drugs. All the evidence points against Hargobind, and not a single lawyer is willing to take his case; his wife kills herself, and the marriage of his daughter has been canceled.",
