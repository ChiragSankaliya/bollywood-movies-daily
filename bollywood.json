Since he doesn't believe in herd mentality, he and his two best friends, Raunak (Pratik Gandhi) and Deepu (Shivam Parekh) start looking for unique ways to make it big in the world. During this trial and error phase, Jai realizes his dream. But his decision of choosing an unprofitable career path doesn’t go down too well with his father (Neeraj Sood), who has bigger aspirations for him. Therefore, in order to bring stability in his life, his father decides to get him married. Destiny, however, has something else in store for Jai, when he accidentally meets Avni (Kritika Kamra), an ambitious, MBA graduate, who wants to start her own business. Set in the backdrop of the Gujarati milieu, the film traces Jai and Avni’s personal journey, as they both find themselves and discover the true meaning of friendship in the bargain.",

The serenity of village life amidst the Himalayas reaches the peak of sublimity as the visual tour is accompanied by some of the most melodious songs rendered by Mohit Chauhan and Pavithra Chari which strike the heart strings of even those who are unfamiliar with the Pahari dialect. The movie provides a perfect audio-visual setting for a beautiful confluence of the emotional journeys of a daughter, a mother and an orphaned boy as the sun sets on their lives and dusk sets in. Saanjh was the first film in Himachali dialect to be released in cinema halls across India.",

At the airport they are received by their tour-guide, Ranga, who appears to be somewhat disturbed upon hearing Googly’s name. An incomprehensible sadness betrays Ranga’s cool demeanor. Googly is awestruck by the beauty of sunset amidst the snow-capped mountains and is inspired to go hiking.  Shorya, though initially reluctant, finally yields. They set out on their trek and the appalling beauty of the mountains overwhelms them. In a moment of romantic fervour, Shorya slips and falls off the cliff and gets stuck on a crest at the edge of a steep fall. Hereafter, the movie follows Googly and Ranga on their individual rescue missions-- Googly’s to save Shorya and Ranga’s to find Googly. And amidst all this, flitting on and off the screen, is a ghastly figure in the cave whom Shorya dismisses as a figment of his own imagination",
