    "overview": "The story follows Rajni, a shape-shifting cobra (Ichchadhari Naagin) who marries a civilian, Rajiv, to avenge the death of her spouse at the hands of an evil saint. Rajiv, who comes from a wealthy family, returns to India after studying in London. His mother wants him to marry Vijaya Singh, but he falls in love with Rajni, an orphan. His mother initially opposes the marriage but later agrees. Their happiness is disrupted when Bhairon Nath, a sadhu with the ability to control snakes, arrives and reveals that Rajni is actually a Naagin seeking revenge. Bhairon Nath has his own sinister motives—he wants to capture Rajni because she knows the location of a hidden Mani, a sacred jewel that would grant him immense power. A dramatic battle ensues, leading to Bhairon Nath’s defeat, and Rajiv and Rajni live happily ever after.",
