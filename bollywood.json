One day, a wealthy childless couple came to the orphanage, wishing to adopt one of the boys. Their choice fell on Munna. However, upon learning that the child's mother was alive, they changed their minds and left, leaving a gold amulet around the boy's neck. That night, Munna could not sleep: pain and longing weighed heavily on his little heart. The boy ran away from the orphanage and set off for Bombay in search of his mother. He was determined to find her.",

Mr. Saxena borrows money from elderly people, assuring them of returning the loan with a handsome rate of interest after about 20 years, knowing fully well that none of them will survive 20 years. Then he meets with the son of one of such lender, aptly named after him viz. Raj K. Saxena. Mr. Saxena refuses to repay the amount, swallows the proof, the only evidence, and asks Raj to get out, which he does so. Raj is determined to get his money, and wants Kiran to fall in love with him. Kiran does so, and brings him over to introduce him to her shocked and speechless dad. Things change when Raj inherits a large amount of money, ironically left by Mr. Saxena maternal grandmother, and it is Mr. Saxena who is now anxious to get in the good books of Raj, with hilarious results.",

About 25 years later, Amarnath returns to Darjeeling, driving an expensive Mercedes, hoping to relax. He casually makes inquiries about Chanda and her father, and finds out that Harihar passed away long ago; Chanda got pregnant and was hastily married to a aged and invalid man, gave birth to a baby girl, subsequently became insane, and died. He also finds out that Chanda sent her daughter, Kajli, away to another town to study and become a doctor. Amarnath is shocked and full of guilt at the injustice and anguish he has caused Chanda and her family. Then he gets to meet Kajli, who is not studying medicine - but earning her living in a brothel - as a foul-mouthed prostitute.",
