But times are hard, and jobs are difficult to come by. When Bholanath loses his job, Ramaiya decides to find employment, and does so as a menial worker in the same mill his dad used to work. Ramaiya is very popular with his co-workers and they soon elect him as their new union leader. This puts Ramaiya in conflict with the Management of the Mill, headed by the owner, Kapoor, who has ordered that Ramaiya be eliminated post haste. But Ramaiya is determined to address the workers' grievances, and he gets himself framed for theft; has the police on the lookout for him, and so Ramaiya goes into hiding.",

Rajiv, who comes from a wealthy family, returns to India after studying in London. His mother wants him to marry Vijaya Singh, but he falls in love with Rajni, an orphan. His mother initially opposes the marriage but later agrees. Their happiness is disrupted when Bhairon Nath, a sadhu with the ability to control snakes, arrives and reveals that Rajni is actually a Naagin seeking revenge. Bhairon Nath has his own sinister motives—he wants to capture Rajni because she knows the location of a hidden Mani, a sacred jewel that would grant him immense power. A dramatic battle ensues, leading to Bhairon Nath’s defeat, and Rajiv and Rajni live happily ever after.",
