When he lands a lucky date with 'Chandigarh Ki Shakira', Jasleen, he decides to sneak out his Dad's brand new Maruti without a second thought. After a mad night at a pub, a fun drive around the famous Gehri route and one peck on the cheek, Sameer ends up losing the car. The car was meant to be a gift for his sister on her wedding and is probably the only thing his stingy dad, Tej Khullar ever spent money on. With only three days to find it, he must ensure his dad doesn't get a whiff of what he has done. Else, he will be turned into butter chicken. Sameer's life will be turned upside down as he comes face-to-face with some insane characters like a Bhai from chor bazaar, an old man with a rifle pointed at his nose and of course, the Chandigarh cops.",

One day, while walking through the estate, he discovers a single burnt apple tree. A few days later, more trees are burnt. Dev and his manager monitor the workers on the plantations and this leads to unrest. A group of nomads comes under suspicion and a corrupt police officer gets involved, while loyal men camp out in the orchards to keep a vigilant watch at night. Despite all these measures, a massive fire breaks out a week later and engulfs an entire mountainside of trees. In his search for the culprit, Dev resorts to armed violence. The slow burning of the orchards forces him to face the truth about himself and his family.",
