Casualty figures vary, but the explosion was of such intensity that it was recorded in Simla - about 2000 kms away. Fact and fiction come together in a dramatic way.

Rajesh Khanna (Dharmendra) a psychiatrist takes on the case of Meena Kumari. Every bit of evidence points to Meena Kumari's instability. Her attempts to prove that she is Radha and not Nanda turn out to be futile. Is Meena Kumari Nanda or Radha? Is she insane or being driven insane? Can she prove who she is?",

Holding her child close to her chest one last time, she left him at the door and disappeared as quietly as she had come. Only the moon and stars were silent witnesses to her deed, the cry of a desperate soul. \"Munna\" means \"baby\" in Hindi. That is what the owner of the orphanage named the foundling. Years passed. One day, a wealthy childless couple came to the orphanage, wishing to adopt one of the boys. Their choice fell on Munna. However, upon learning that the child's mother was alive, they changed their minds and left, leaving a gold amulet around the boy's neck. That night, Munna could not sleep: pain and longing weighed heavily on his little heart. The boy ran away from the orphanage and set off for Bombay in search of his mother. He was determined to find her.",

When Maan Singh learns about a treasure of gold that is about to change hands at a wedding reception, the target of their next heist is clear. They have no idea that it is an ambush of the police. Some of the gang members barely manage to escape and flee into the inhospitably barren surrounding area. While a dispute arises about how to proceed, they meet a woman from the lowest caste who is being hunted by a family clan. In their care there is a girl who was raped and seriously injured by the leader of that clan. The bandits see the opportunity to atone for their shameful crime.",
