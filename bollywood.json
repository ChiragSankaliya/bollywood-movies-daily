His son Ajit Mehta offers a weak foil to Hasmukh's assertive behavior. His wife Sonal is the butt of his jokes and an easy target for his blame games. Ajit's wife, Preeti copes with her father's insufferable behavior by simply giving in. All are waiting for the day the old man will die and leave his vast fortunes to them. He does die, but he does not leave his fortunes to them. Not only that he uses his money as a bait to make them act according to his will, literally ruling them from his grave through a convoluted will that has them doing exactly what he wants them to do. Through his will, he instructs his mistress Kiran Jhaveri to live with his family, using her as a proxy for him, while he enjoys his power even as a ghost! But even the most perfect of plans don't always go the way they are supposed to.",

Father O'Hara (Victor Banerjee), a missionary doctor with the help of his caretaker Maularam (Sudarshan Juyal), raises an orphan baby Josef (Hitesh Bisht). While still a young boy, Josef is sent to Dehradun, Uttarakhand, for his studies and vocational training. Josef (Subrat Dutta) returns back with a reputation as a great cook as well as his love for alcohol. The film explores in its unfolding of time, the different paths that Father O'Hara, Josef, and Maularam take in their respective journeys for spiritual fulfillment through memories, duty, and search as well as the their interaction with friends and acquaintances. Through static mis-en-scenes, the narrative of the film reflects the all-encompassing nature of time, pre-empting and repeating itself in allegorical hues.",
