However, when there is a lot more to it with dancing, talking and making merry accompanied by drinking, partying and making love, a connect is bound to be formed. A connect, which is subconscious, only to be realized when destiny has its own games to play! They are happy and content as individuals. But together they are happier, more at peace. They believe that they have already found love in respective lives. Together, they realize that this intense love they have for each other is something very different. Gaurav and Pooja may not be hunting for love as they truly feel that they have it all. But can one truly ignore the signs of something special that bonds the two together?",

One day, while walking through the estate, he discovers a single burnt apple tree. A few days later, more trees are burnt. Dev and his manager monitor the workers on the plantations and this leads to unrest. A group of nomads comes under suspicion and a corrupt police officer gets involved, while loyal men camp out in the orchards to keep a vigilant watch at night. Despite all these measures, a massive fire breaks out a week later and engulfs an entire mountainside of trees. In his search for the culprit, Dev resorts to armed violence. The slow burning of the orchards forces him to face the truth about himself and his family.",
