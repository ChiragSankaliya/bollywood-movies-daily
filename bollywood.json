Though nobody had any proof in support of this, but subsequent incidents gave substance to it. Just two days after his death, as his maid servant was bringing his only Son SUDHIR to Champa Nagar by train the child disappeared on the way. Hardly could the shock of this news subside, when one stormy night his nephew Jugal and sister's son Shekhar came together to  \"MOTI MAHAL\" to hear the WILL from Vakil. But Lo! the Vakil himself vanished and his dead body was picked up in the palace-compound, sometime later.",

The film also portrays the fascination for American materialism, the hype around the IT industry and the lifestyle and culture it has spawned.",
