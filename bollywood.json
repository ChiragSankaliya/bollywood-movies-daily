Our film seeks to explore the dimension of evil that resides within our minds and how it reflects onto the perceptions of the Hijra community. For us, this film is very special, as it is a product of our personal experiences and the desire to showcase the struggle and bliss of the third gender. We aim to tell a story that is engaging, sensitive, and respectful. Our team is excited to bring this project to life, and we hope that it will contribute to a greater understanding and appreciation of the Hijra community.",

As events unfold in real time, captured in a seamless single take, Krishna races against time to uncover the truth and protect his brother before it's too late. Tensions rise, loyalties are tested, and hidden motives come to light in this powerful and immersive cinematic experience.

But this is no ordinary story. Told through the voice of Laqeer, a personified boundary burdened by the weight of separation, the film explores the quiet aftermath of the Partition- not just the displacement, but the lingering absence, the unanswered letters, the daunting secrets, and the wounds that time cannot heal.  With poetry, music, and unforgettable characters, Gajar Ka Halwa is a poignant reflection on love that lingers- warm, wistful, and bittersweet, just like the first bite of something once familiar yet forever changed.",
