A check of their belongings, including a video camera, shows pictures of prominent places, prompting Om Prakash to summon Vijay D. Chauhan, from the Anti-Terrorist Squad. The latter shows up, is initially skeptical, but after he overhears a rather incriminating conversation between Ankit and a woman named Prachi, is convinced that the four may be terrorists and interrogates them. The four steadfastly deny their involvement in any terrorist activity - but must face up to the situation when a fifth suspect, a woman named Diana, claims that they belong to her group - which has already made plans to blow up the airport today.",

It is a story of 15-year-old Aditya (Aditya Seal) and his voyeuristic love of his nameless neighbor (Manisha Koirala) featuring bathroom masturbation scenes — which are virtually unseen in Bollywood. Soon Aditya’s hobby turns into infatuation as he begins to follow her movements closely. He feels sexually drawn towards her when he sees her coming out of her bath, her hair dripping wet. He feels jealous when he catches her making love with her boyfriend (Ranvir Shorey).  Manisha is unaware of her secret admirer. When the boy musters up the courage and speaks his heart to her, she takes it in her stride and gives him a little teaser on adolescent love.",
