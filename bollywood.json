Distrusting his son and his new wife, Roopa, he asks a village laborer, Sunder who is honest, loyal and hardworking, to marry his daughter. In this manner, Sunder and Kalpana get married, and soon Kalpana gives birth to a daughter. Tragically Kalpana passes away, and the Thakur, Sunder, and the child are devastated. The Thakur asks Sunder to get married to Savitri, who is the daughter of his childhood friend, the local Collector. He hopes that in this manner the child will get the love of a mother. Sunder reluctantly agrees, and soon Savitri and he get married. Savitri is unable to win the love of the child nor does she get any affection from Sunder, as he is unable to get Kalpana out of his mind and thoughts. In the meantime, Roopa's dad is plotting the death of Sunder, so that his daughter can take over the wealth of the Thakur after his death.",

Distrusting his son and his new wife, Roopa, he asks a village laborer, Sunder who is honest, loyal and hardworking, to marry his daughter. In this manner, Sunder and Kalpana get married, and soon Kalpana gives birth to a daughter. Tragically Kalpana passes away, and the Thakur, Sunder, and the child are devastated. The Thakur asks Sunder to get married to Savitri, who is the daughter of his childhood friend, the local Collector. He hopes that in this manner the child will get the love of a mother. Sunder reluctantly agrees, and soon Savitri and he get married. Savitri is unable to win the love of the child nor does she get any affection from Sunder, as he is unable to get Kalpana out of his mind and thoughts. In the meantime, Roopa's dad is plotting the death of Sunder, so that his daughter can take over the wealth of the Thakur after his death.",

    "overview": "In a small town, situated in a picturesque Indian valley, lives a corrupt Deputy collector, Hare Murari, an equally corrupt Police Superintendent, Pasupathi; a doctor; a Judge; and Professor Rampyare. These officials always ensure that no one gets anything done without their permission, thus ensuring that their palms are adequately greased. When a young man named Prem Pratap seeks a license for conducting a song and dance sequence, he too is asked to bribe them, which he does. Subsequently, Hare Murari finds out that Prem Pratap may be a Government Official who has come incognito to investigate and expose them. Hare Murari's and the others worst fears are realized when they find out that Prem has been speaking long distance with none other than the President of India. What follows is hilarious chaos as the officials come together to try and portray themselves as honest and law-abiding citizens.",
