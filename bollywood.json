However, upon learning that the child's mother was alive, they changed their minds and left, leaving a gold amulet around the boy's neck. That night, Munna could not sleep: pain and longing weighed heavily on his little heart. The boy ran away from the orphanage and set off for Bombay in search of his mother. He was determined to find her.",
