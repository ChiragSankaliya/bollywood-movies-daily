Singer Kamaal Khan appeared first time on big screen in a negative role. This movie was his debut movie as actor.  The film's release was met by protests from Sikh groups, who took offense at its use of a Sikh religious phrase as its title,[1] as well as scenes in which a Sikh police officer is shown being chased by scantily-clad women[citation needed]. Two bomb attacks on 22 May 2005 on theatres in New Delhi showing the film killed one person and injured 49, prompting cinema owners to pull the film, in some cases voluntarily and in some states as a result of a government order.",

He makes four vows to his Guru, that he would never eat in a gold plate, never lead a procession that is in his honour, never become a king and never marry a princess, thinking all of them are far out possibilities for him. Later, his guru adds a fifth one - never to tell a lie and sets him of on his life's journey which leads him to a kingdom..",
