Seema being the daughter of a rich businessman and Suraj being a police inspector with a modest income, are destined to face the objection of Seema's father (Amrish Puri) to their marriage. Amrish creates misunderstanding in Seema's heart for Suraj and she starts looking upon him as a greedy person who discarded her love for the sake of money. But the problem is that she has already got pregnant through him and after the demise of her father, she moves to the region of the Himalayas, giving birth to Abhay (Akshaye Khanna).  Abhay grows up misunderstanding his father by learning his mother's version of the past events. He falls in love with Esha (Anjala Zaveri) who is the daughter of their neighbor - Major Mathur (Satish Shah) but love is less important for him. What is more important for him is to locate his father and settle scores with him for his mother's sorrows.",

High up in the Indian Himalayas, where even the birds fly low to avoid getting lost in the clouds, the soft-spoken Dev owns a sprawling estate of several orchards and lives in a colonial-style house with his family. He spends a lot of his time building human-sized wings which he puts on to take a quick morning flight over his land. One day, while walking through the estate, he discovers a single burnt apple tree. A few days later, more trees are burnt. Dev and his manager monitor the workers on the plantations and this leads to unrest. A group of nomads comes under suspicion and a corrupt police officer gets involved, while loyal men camp out in the orchards to keep a vigilant watch at night. Despite all these measures, a massive fire breaks out a week later and engulfs an entire mountainside of trees. In his search for the culprit, Dev resorts to armed violence. The slow burning of the orchards forces him to face the truth about himself and his family.",

He spends a lot of his time building human-sized wings which he puts on to take a quick morning flight over his land. One day, while walking through the estate, he discovers a single burnt apple tree. A few days later, more trees are burnt. Dev and his manager monitor the workers on the plantations and this leads to unrest. A group of nomads comes under suspicion and a corrupt police officer gets involved, while loyal men camp out in the orchards to keep a vigilant watch at night. Despite all these measures, a massive fire breaks out a week later and engulfs an entire mountainside of trees. In his search for the culprit, Dev resorts to armed violence. The slow burning of the orchards forces him to face the truth about himself and his family.",
