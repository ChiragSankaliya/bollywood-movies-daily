He would like Amar to find employment for himself on his merit rather than use his contacts, but Amar is unable to secure any employment. Then wealthy Daulatram insults Siddhanth, accuses him of using Amar as a ploy to woo his daughter Priya, so that the Sharma family can inherit his wealth. An angered Siddhanth confronts Amar, who grabs a knife and warns Daulatram. Shortly thereafter, the police arrest Amar for killing Daulatram. Siddhant disbelieves him, but Sheila decides to don her black gown and represent her brother-in-law, against the overwhelming evidence that has surfaced against him. It is now up to Sheila to not only defend Amar but also attempt to find out the reason behind Daulatram's death.",

As for the people on the Chinese story, is another story altogether, as they are ruled by a cruel and self-serving emperor, Deng Do Rani, who sends armed men and women to resist any effort to build this bridge. A group of these men, and a woman named Soo Reni are captured and held for questioning. Vijay and Soo Reni fall in love, and Soo Reni decides to assist Vijay in his task. It is then she realizes that she has alienated herself from her very own people, who have now been issued orders to kill her on one hand, and is regarded with distrust and suspicion by the people on the Indian side on the other.",
