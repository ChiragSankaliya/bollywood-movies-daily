But her hopes are dashed when Vikram asks her to vacate the premise until she comes up with Rs.52 Lakhs. Then two Gorakhpur-born naive males, Ram and Shyam Yadav, come to her for a make-over and blurt out that they are going to abduct Vikram's son, Aditya, and hold him until his father pays a huge ransom.

They find out that the kidnapping is supposed to take place at a Mythological theme party, and they make all due preparations - not realizing that Murphy's Law will soon prevail and everything will get out of control.",

One day a frightened, lonely woman arrives on the scene and she is taken in by the two men. She cooks and cleans, and before long becomes a source of contention.

Men still come to the door in the hope of seeing Shamshad and do not seem too put out by seeing Salma despite her protestations. The couple struggle to live within the bounds of their own moral code while the earnings of prostitution seem to be flaunted around them. Hamid gets more and more angry and seemingly unable to reconcile his morality with the immorality of the world and at one point beats his wife and then rapes her making her into a 'whore' of his fantasy. The story here bears resemblance to the later 'Ek Chadar Maili Si' by the same director and seems to explore the complex world of women and sexuality as viewed by Indian men: mother, goddess, whore. This film also explores the ethos of prostitution in its reality and as a metaphor for the outside world.",
