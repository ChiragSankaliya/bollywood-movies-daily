Ramakant is honest and dedicated, and in a corrupt city, is considered a major liability. Vishal is hot-tempered, and this often leads him into fist fights. When Vishal witnesses a murder, and is able to identify the killer, the son of a prominent and well-known person, his father disbelieves his son, and is reluctant to arrest the culprit. He does reconsider, and goes ahead with the arrest, only to have his wife, Parvati, abducted and released - with a time-bomb tied to her waist. Vishal and Ramakant must now decide whether to save their mother and wife respectively, or to compromise with the killer, his father, and corrupt elements within the police force itself.",

He is constantly being made a target by the oppressive local Zamindar and his two children, Sagar and Chanchal. The land owner's children decide to take revenge on Raja by getting Sagar married to Raja's sweetheart Neela. The Zamindar also molests Raja's sister, who kills herself. With his Neela married and his sister dead, a devastated Raja heads to the city. Once over there he attempts to put his life together, and try to forget the past. It is then he meets with another victim of the Zamindar, Bajrangi (Mehmood) and together they conceive a plan that will avenge them against their oppressors.
