The flat had been the former home of a well known mujra and qawali singer, Shamshad. Men still come to the door in the hope of seeing Shamshad and do not seem too put out by seeing Salma despite her protestations. The couple struggle to live within the bounds of their own moral code while the earnings of prostitution seem to be flaunted around them. Hamid gets more and more angry and seemingly unable to reconcile his morality with the immorality of the world and at one point beats his wife and then rapes her making her into a 'whore' of his fantasy. The story here bears resemblance to the later 'Ek Chadar Maili Si' by the same director and seems to explore the complex world of women and sexuality as viewed by Indian men: mother, goddess, whore. This film also explores the ethos of prostitution in its reality and as a metaphor for the outside world.",

Casualty figures vary, but the explosion was of such intensity that it was recorded in Simla - about 2000 kms away. Fact and fiction come together in a dramatic way. Nanda and Radha are two sisters, living with their wealthy parents near Mazgaon Docks. Nanda is married to Subodh Rai from Darjeeling and has a daughter, Nalini. This family is affected by the blast. Rajesh Khanna (Dharmendra) a psychiatrist takes on the case of Meena Kumari. Every bit of evidence points to Meena Kumari's instability. Her attempts to prove that she is Radha and not Nanda turn out to be futile. Is Meena Kumari Nanda or Radha? Is she insane or being driven insane? Can she prove who she is?",
