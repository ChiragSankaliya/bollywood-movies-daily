When he returns home to visit his \"ailing\" mother, his father instructs him to take Chanda with him to Bombay, as her rightful place is with Kishan. Kishan agrees to do so. Upon arrival in Bombay, Chanda is shocked to find out that Kishan is married to an attractive woman by the name of Radha. Now Chanda must decide whether to expose Kishan's dual life; to simply return to her parents' home; commit suicide. Or will Radha opt for a fourth option?",

This gem is placed in a secure room within his palace, which is alarmed, and guarded. He challenges one of them to steal the Shalimar - but if anyone fails then they are killed by the security system.
