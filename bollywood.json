The flat had been the former home of a well known mujra and qawali singer, Shamshad. Men still come to the door in the hope of seeing Shamshad and do not seem too put out by seeing Salma despite her protestations. The couple struggle to live within the bounds of their own moral code while the earnings of prostitution seem to be flaunted around them. Hamid gets more and more angry and seemingly unable to reconcile his morality with the immorality of the world and at one point beats his wife and then rapes her making her into a 'whore' of his fantasy. The story here bears resemblance to the later 'Ek Chadar Maili Si' by the same director and seems to explore the complex world of women and sexuality as viewed by Indian men: mother, goddess, whore. This film also explores the ethos of prostitution in its reality and as a metaphor for the outside world.",

On the way to celebrate their honeymoon, they spend a night at Sunil's boss's bungalow, which is occupied by his son, Dhiraj. Dhiraj welcomes the two, and allows them to spend the night. Next morning, when Sunil leaves the house, Dhiraj sexually assaults Sonia, but he is interrupted by Sunil's return. A fight ensues, and Dhiraj is killed. The police arrest Sunil, and he is sentenced to prison for life. On the way to the prison, a fight breaks out amongst the prisoners, and the driver loses control, killing all occupants of the van.
