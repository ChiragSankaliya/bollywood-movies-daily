On the way to celebrate their honeymoon, they spend a night at Sunil's boss's bungalow, which is occupied by his son, Dhiraj. Dhiraj welcomes the two, and allows them to spend the night. Next morning, when Sunil leaves the house, Dhiraj sexually assaults Sonia, but he is interrupted by Sunil's return. A fight ensues, and Dhiraj is killed. The police arrest Sunil, and he is sentenced to prison for life. On the way to the prison, a fight breaks out amongst the prisoners, and the driver loses control, killing all occupants of the van. Devastated at this turn of events, Sonia relocates and becomes a school-teacher and lives as a widow. Years later, she finds out that Sunil is still alive, now goes by the name ‘Sudhir’, is married to a rich and attractive woman named Chandni, and even has a child.",

Amarnath has detached himself completely from Vicky s life, and provides him money in lieu of affection and care, living this to be taken care off by Munshi Phoolchand. Vicky is very resentful of being ignored by his dad in this manner, and leaves no stone unturned to mock and belittle him at every available opportunity. Amarnath hopes to get his son married, but Vicky loves the daughter of a poor blind man, Meena, which is not acceptable to Amarnath. One day Amarnath decides he has had enough and decides to turn Vicky out of his house. He has him sign waivers, and asks him to get out, which Vicky does so. While Vicky is relieved of being freed from his dad s control, the question remains that with no skills at making a living, how is Vicky to survive in a cold-hearted world",
