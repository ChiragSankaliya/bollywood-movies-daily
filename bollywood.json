This puts Ramaiya in conflict with the Management of the Mill, headed by the owner, Kapoor, who has ordered that Ramaiya be eliminated post haste. But Ramaiya is determined to address the workers' grievances, and he gets himself framed for theft; has the police on the lookout for him, and so Ramaiya goes into hiding.",

About 25 years later, Amarnath returns to Darjeeling, driving an expensive Mercedes, hoping to relax. He casually makes inquiries about Chanda and her father, and finds out that Harihar passed away long ago; Chanda got pregnant and was hastily married to a aged and invalid man, gave birth to a baby girl, subsequently became insane, and died. He also finds out that Chanda sent her daughter, Kajli, away to another town to study and become a doctor. Amarnath is shocked and full of guilt at the injustice and anguish he has caused Chanda and her family. Then he gets to meet Kajli, who is not studying medicine - but earning her living in a brothel - as a foul-mouthed prostitute.",

Amarnath is shocked and full of guilt at the injustice and anguish he has caused Chanda and her family.
