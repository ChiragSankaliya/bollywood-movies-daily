Another don in the city named Aatma, who is the opposition of Kakha (Rahul Dev) asks Munna to join him. But Munna refuses his proposal. Munna starts to beat Kakha and the mind game begins. Kakha's second wife and son-daughter left him and join Munna. After some incidents including the death of his best friend, Munna finds out that Aatma was working for Kakha all along.",

Though there is nothing malicious between the groups, they just can't see eye to eye on anything. The only thing common between the two are their abiding passion for rugby. Whenever a problem crops between the two, it is usually settled with a bitter scrum on the rugby field. As it happens, the college land falls into the hands of a local dadha Bikshu Yadav. This is good enough reason for the two groups to forge a common identity and fight for the land. Prithvi and Shashank bury the hatchet and get back the land. This is too much of a bitter pill for the dadha to swallow. And so he dares the students for a rugby match with his own group.",
