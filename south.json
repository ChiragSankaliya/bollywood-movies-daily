Maha Lakshmi also responds to Buchi Babu and they fall in love.  Maha Lakshmi’s father Subba Rao (M.S.Narayana) does not approve of this alliance as Buchi Raju is not a rich guy. To win Maha Lakshmi’s hand, Buchi Raju promises to earn a lot of money within 6 months and leaves.  What happens next? Will Buchi Raju succeed in his efforts? That forms the story of this film.",
