The film was a hit at the box office. This is Gopichand's third consecutive hit as a lead actor. The film was dubbed into Tamil as \"Stalin\" and remade into Oriya as \"Mahanayak\".  Maheswari (Kamna Jethmalani) is sister of Bhagawati (Biju Menon), a mafia don in Hyderabad. Chinna (Gopichand), classmate of Maheshwari, inadvertently enters into a row with the gang members of Bhagawati, and falls in love with Maheswari. The rest of the story is all about how Chinna resorts to a mind game on Bhagavati to win his sister.",
