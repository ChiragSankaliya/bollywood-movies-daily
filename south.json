His persevering brother (Sijju) manages to send him to the Gulf. But alas, when Siva actually lands in Dubai, he realizes he has been duped by the recruitment company and eventually he gets framed in a murder case. Siva’s brother who comes to Dubai to help matters out is killed. This is good enough reason for Siva to take a vow to kill the killers of his brother. He does that eventually after a ketchup show of mayhem and some misplaced songs. Woven into this are the story of his love and that of a night club dancer in Dubai (Navneet Kaur and Meghana Naidu).",

The suspicions are on Swamy who is arrested, but an old man calling himself Okka Magadu (Nandamuri Balakrishna) claims to have committed those acts. The point is, OM looks like the older version of Swamy whose sworn enemy is Namboodriyar(Ashutosh Rana), a politician whose son elopes with a middle-class girl under Swamy's protection. The story line is very much similar to that of the film Bharateyudu (Indian (1996 film)) starred by the iconic actor Kamal Haasan.Movie was a blockbuster hit.",

Suresh Krishna has tried to match the present cast with that of the original. His selection of script is an upset to the audience. He has selected Vishnu in lead but failed to have actual grip on the movie.  Vishnu has performed well as a responsible IPS officer. This can be stated as his best job till now. The guy has a long way to go. Anushka, as Vishnu's ladylove, adds glamour to the movie. Though Jackie Shroff's role is short, his performance is fine. The technical aspects of the movie are pass muster. Music by S.A.Rajkumar is a mediocre. Suresh Krishna's direction, screenplay are okay.",
