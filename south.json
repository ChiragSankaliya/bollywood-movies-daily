Whenever a problem crops between the two, it is usually settled with a bitter scrum on the rugby field. As it happens, the college land falls into the hands of a local dadha Bikshu Yadav. This is good enough reason for the two groups to forge a common identity and fight for the land. Prithvi and Shashank bury the hatchet and get back the land. This is too much of a bitter pill for the dadha to swallow. And so he dares the students for a rugby match with his own group.",

One of the children is accidentally injured and, on the suggestion of an ayurvedic guru that the cure for this injury can be found on the banks of Manasa Sarovar, Raju goes to the Himalayas. During the same time, a celestial being, Indraja (Sridevi), the daughter of Lord Indra, happens to visit the Manasa Sarovar. She accidentally drops her ring, which is her passport to the Heaven. Raju finds this ring and starts wearing it, unaware of its divine power. Because Indraja is unable to enter Heaven, Brihaspathi, the Deva-guru, allows her to go back to Earth to retrieve it before the next Kartik Poornima.",

As pressure builds on Police and Government to track down the Man who masterminds these killings, Balbir Singh (Puneet Issar), is specially summoned to head the task. He is aided by Suryam (Prakash Raj) who, though being just a constable in the mammoth Police force, is compelled by his instincts to see through the underlying design. Together they unravel the mystery and unveil the phenomenon called Tagore, but not before Badrinaryana (Sayaji Shinde), the human face of evil, finds out that his revelry in the belief of Tagore’s death was a mistake he can never make amends for.",
