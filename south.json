    "overview": "During the days of the Vijayanagara Empire there was a system to bring willing women to the royal palace and render them official residents. This was called 'Rani Vasam'. According to this royal tradition, they sent palanquins to their houses, after they presented the family with gifts and jewelry. These Rani Vasam women should never have any contact with any man or let any man see them without permission. If any one violated the law, they were beheaded.  Malleswari (Bhanumathi) was taken to this Rani Vasam. She was forced to accept this, for lure of money and jewelry by her parents. But she was already in love with her 'Bava' Nagaraju (N.T. Rama Rao), a sculptor. He stealthily got into the garden of the palace to meet his beloved and was caught. He was to get the death penalty. Krishnadevaraya for once pardoned the hero and allowed Malleswari to go with him.",

Ravi (Ravi Teja), an orphan, falls in love with Sasi and she also slowly develops feelings for Ravi. One day Ravi meets Sasi's father in the outskirts of the city and tells him all about his love. However, he is accidentally killed by Ravi in a scuffle. Sasi soon finds out that the real culprit is Ravi. Infuriated, she breaks up with him. Ravi, unable to bear the rejection, jumps from a hill. He escapes death, only to be told by the doctors that he is disabled and might be cured in the future if someone took care of him. In the climax, Sasi decides to stay with Ravi, who is nothing but a vegetable now, stating that what ever he did was just because of his love for her and she still is in love with him.
