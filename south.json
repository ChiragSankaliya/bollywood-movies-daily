A true modern-day warrior who led the \"Plastic Free Tirupati\" movement with an example, turning personal conviction into a collective awakening.  The \"Eighth Hill\" stands as a reflection of our own atrocities. An unsettling mirror showing how what we dismiss as a single piece of trash can grow into a mountain of consequence.
