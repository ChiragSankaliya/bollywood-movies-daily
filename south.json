These Rani Vasam women should never have any contact with any man or let any man see them without permission. If any one violated the law, they were beheaded.  Malleswari (Bhanumathi) was taken to this Rani Vasam. She was forced to accept this, for lure of money and jewelry by her parents. But she was already in love with her 'Bava' Nagaraju (N.T. Rama Rao), a sculptor. He stealthily got into the garden of the palace to meet his beloved and was caught. He was to get the death penalty. Krishnadevaraya for once pardoned the hero and allowed Malleswari to go with him.",

As pressure builds on Police and Government to track down the Man who masterminds these killings, Balbir Singh (Puneet Issar), is specially summoned to head the task. He is aided by Suryam (Prakash Raj) who, though being just a constable in the mammoth Police force, is compelled by his instincts to see through the underlying design. Together they unravel the mystery and unveil the phenomenon called Tagore, but not before Badrinaryana (Sayaji Shinde), the human face of evil, finds out that his revelry in the belief of Tagore’s death was a mistake he can never make amends for.",
