Whenever a problem crops between the two, it is usually settled with a bitter scrum on the rugby field. As it happens, the college land falls into the hands of a local dadha Bikshu Yadav.

This is too much of a bitter pill for the dadha to swallow. And so he dares the students for a rugby match with his own group.",
