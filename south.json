    "overview": "Achi Babu (Allari Naresh), Sathi Babu (Sunil) and Suri Babu (Prabhu Deva) are the best buddies since childhood. They form a band that does multi purpose jobs like acting as band of boys for marriages, professional catchers of dogs, and cremation service guys. Karate Malliswari (Gajala), another childhood nightmarish karate-skill-flaunting damsel, lures Achi Babu into love. Then she snatches Achi Babu away from Suri Babu and Sathi Babu to make him her live-in boy friend. They also get engaged to each other. Irritated by their act, Suri Babu and Sathi Babu kidnap Malliswari. They tie her to a chair and then hatch another plan to make Achi Babu believe that Malliswari is dead. In that process, they dig a 'fresh' dead body from a crematorium, pack her in the car of Malliswari and throw that car into a valley. Police confirms that Malliswari is dead and Achi Babu's heart breaks again.",
