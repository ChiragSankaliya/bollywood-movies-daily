On his brothers' request, Rajaram approaches Devi for her sisters' hands in marriage to his brothers. But she curtly refuses her consent on grounds that the two are wayward drunkards. Rajaram reacts sharply to it and vows to get his brothers married to her sisters.  Since then on he is more exacting with his brothers and brings about a transformation in them. Devi agrees to their marriage.",
