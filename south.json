One chance meeting with Netra (Regina), a MP's daughter, turns into friendship and love blossoms. One day, they head to Kotilingala to do the jagaranam (staying awake at the night) in the temple. Late in the night, Netra's throat is slit by some unknown persons and immediately they take her to the hospital. Naturally Shourya becomes the suspect. What really happened? Who did this? Or has Shourya slit her throat as the police believe?  Shourya (Manchu Manoj) is a highly educated individual who is in deep love with Nethra (Regina Cassendra). Due to unknown reasons, the couple decide to elope but an unfortunate series of events lead to Nethra being murdered. Twist in the tale arises when Shourya gets framed for the murder.",
